# DeepSeek R1 vs Gemini Experiment

This project is a comparative study between DeepSeek R1 and Google Gemini, focusing on their capabilities in task automation and AI-driven decision-making using only free tools and services. The experiment evaluates both models based on various parameters, including accuracy, efficiency, task execution, and adaptability. The primary objective is to determine which model performs better in automating real-world tasks, such as booking tickets, reserving hotels, and handling multi-step workflows. The study involves rigorous testing of both AI models in controlled environments, analyzing their responses, and measuring their computational efficiency. By conducting this experiment, we aim to provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of each model, helping developers and researchers choose the best AI for their automation needs. The findings from this research will be documented in detail, ensuring transparency and reproducibility for future comparisons and improvements in AI-based automation.
